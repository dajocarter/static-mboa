Correct! Lymphedema is an accumulation of interstitial fluid in the affected region.

How would a complete axillary node dissection (CAD) lead to lymphedema?

You alleviate your patient’s unease by explaining that the margins of her positive lymph nodes were free of disease after the SNL biopsy and a CAD is not necessary. As an additional measure, you advise for a bone and liver scan. Luckily no additional metastasis was seen.
