Correct! Although the lymph node is not physically compartmentalized, it does show three functional regions. The paracortex is the region situated between the cortex and the medulla. Although its boundaries are not clearly delineated, this region can be distinguished by its lack of lymphoid nodules and by the presence of unique blood vessels.
