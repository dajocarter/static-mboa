The spleen’s parenchyma is organized into distinct regions of red and white pulp, which may closely resemble a cortex and medulla of other organs. Note however, that the red and white pulp of the spleen is somewhat uniformly distributed throughout the organ and not organized into distinct layers seen in the patient’s slide.
