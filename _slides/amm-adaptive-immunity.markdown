  * Thymocytes that arrive to the thymus are considered to be in the double-negative stage and do not posses a T-cell receptor (TCR), CD4, or CD8 glycoproteins until they proliferate and begin differentiation in the cortex.
  * Eventually both CD4 and CD8 are expressed (double-positive stage).
  * These na√Øve thymocytes are schooled before they are released into circulation, undergoing a two-stage selection process that begins in the cortex with positive (clonal) selection.

Correct! Adaptive immunity, also known as acquired immunity, develops gradually over time in response to specific antigens (such as proteins, polysaccharides or molecular components of bacteria, viruses, or tumor cells) displayed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and presented to B- and T-lymphocytes.

**Why is this system slow to respond initially but faster with subsequent infections?**
