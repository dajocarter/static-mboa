Correct! Unfortunately, it looks like this *tetralogy* is turning into a *pentalogy*.

In addition to Tetralogy of Fallot, your patient has **patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**.

Typically, the muscularis of the ductus arteriosus contracts when the infant begins breathing, causing the ductus arteriosus to functionally close 24-48 hours after birth. It then completely closes 2-3 weeks after birth forming a fibrous structure known as the **ligamentum arteriosum**. When the ductus arteriosus remains open after birth infants may be subject to a left-to-right shunt, which increases pulmonary flow, decreases lung compliance, and causes dyspnea (shortness of breath) and tachycardia (abnormally high heart rate).

From which aortic arch does the ductus arteriosus derive?
