  Defects in the aorticopulmonary septum are primarily due to problems with which of the following?

  **Select:**

  A. If only 1, 2, and 3 are correct
  B. If only 1 and 3 are correct
  C. If only 2 and 4 are correct
  D. If only 4 is correct

  1. Primary heart field

  2. Secondary heart field

  3. Atrioventricular canal mesenchyme

  4. Cardiac neural crest cells

Correct!

**Stenosis** refers to an abnormal narrowing of a canal or orifice.

**Atresia** is defined as an abnormal absence or complete occlusion of an opening or lumen.

**Pulmonary stenosis** can occur from asymmetrical division during septation of the outflow tract. This may cause **membranous ventricular septal defect** resulting in malalignment of the outflow tract channels.
