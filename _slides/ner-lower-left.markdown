Peyerâ€™s patches are prominent in the submucosa of the ileum (the terminal part of the small intestine) and are composed of groups of lymphoid follicles. Lymphoid follicles are mainly B-lymphocytes and are examples of MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) protecting the mucosal surface of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts.
