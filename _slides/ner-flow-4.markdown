<ol start="4">
<li>Splenic artery → trabecular artery → central arteriole → penicillar arteriole → ensheathed capillary → **splenic sinus** → **splenic cord** → red pulp vein → trabecular vein → splenic vein</li>

Notice that this option reverses the order of flow through the cord and sinus that is seen in open circulation.
