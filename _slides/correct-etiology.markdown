    Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are relatively common anomalies, occurring in approximately 10% of cardiac defects.

    Label the following structures involved in ASDs.

  and ending with foramen ovale.**\n\n**(Write your answer down! We will review this
  at the end)**\n\n![ASD-process.jpeg](/uploads/ASD-process.jpeg)\n\n<video controls><source
  src=\"/uploads/Atrial-septation.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video>\n\nSeveral causes
  of ASD exist, including: \n\n* **Foramen primum defect** - the leading edge of septum
  primum failed to fuse with the endocardial cushions; defect is located __low__ in
  the interatrial septum\n\n* **Foramen secundum defect** - excessive resorption of
  septum primum when forming the foramen secundum may leave an inadequate valve to
  cover foramen ovale (or hypoplastic growth of the septum secundum leaves a foramen
  ovale too large to be covered by the normal-sized valve); defect is __centrally__-located
  within the interatrial septum\n\n* **Sinus venosus defect** - a hole is formed within
  the interatrial septum cranial to foramen ovale caused by abnormal incorporation
  of the right horn of sinus venosus; defect is located __cranial__ to foramen ovale\n\n*
  **Common atrium** - lack of septation\n\n![ASD-locations.jpg](/uploads/ASD-locations.jpg)\n\nAfter
  reviewing the ultrasound image again, you determine that although a septum has formed,
  a  defect has developed in the middle of the interatrial septum. Which type of ASD
  do you suspect?"

Correct! Most CHDs are multifactorial, having both genetic and environmental factors.
