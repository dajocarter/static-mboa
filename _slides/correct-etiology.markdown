    Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are relatively common anomalies, occurring in approximately 10% of cardiac defects.

  List the steps of atrial septation, starting from the septum primum and ending with foramen ovale.

  There are five primary types of ASD:

  * **Patent foramen ovale** - failure of the valve formed by septum primum to completely fuse with the septum secundum after birth (or hypoplastic growth of the septum secundum leaves a foramen ovale too large to be covered by the normal-sized valve)

  * **Foramen secundum defect** - excessive resorption of septum primum when forming the foramen secundum may leave an inadequate valve to cover foramen ovale; defect is centrally-located within the interatrial septum

  * **Foramen primum defect** - the leading edge of septum primum failed to fuse with the endocardial cushions; defect is located low in the interatrial septum

  * **Sinus venosus defect** - a hole is formed within the interatrial septum cranial to foramen ovale caused by abnormal incorporation of the right horn of sinus venosus; defect is located cranial to foramen ovale

  * **Common atrium** - lack of septation

  After reviewing the ultrasound image again, you determine that although a septum has formed, a  defect has developed in the middle of the interatrial septum. Which type of ASD do you suspect?

Correct! Most CHDs are multifactorial, having both genetic and environmental factors.
