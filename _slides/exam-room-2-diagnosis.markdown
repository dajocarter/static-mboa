    Taken together, your patient has four major cardiac defects. This condition is known as **tetralogy of Fallot.** Label the four anomalies seen in this condition indicated below.
  options:
  - label_text: "**A)**"
    answers:
    - overriding aorta
    - Dextroposition of the aorta
    - Dextroposition of aorta
    - aorta dextroposition
    hint_text: Unequal outflow tract division favors the aorta causing it to communicate
      with both ventricles
  - label_text: "**B)**"
    answers:
    - pulmonary stenosis
    hint_text: Abnormal narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract
  - label_text: "**C)**"
    answers:
    - ventricular septal defect
    hint_text: Incomplete septation of the primitive ventricle
  - label_text: "**D)**"
    answers:
    - right ventricular hypertrophy
    - r ventricular hypertrophy
    - right ventricle hypertrophy
    - r ventricle hypertrophy
    hint_text: Enlargement of ventricular myocardium

You conclude the diagnosis is **tetralogy of Fallot.** This anomaly occurs in about 9.6/10,000 births and is the most frequent anomaly of the outflow tract (Sadler, 2015).
