Tetralogy of Fallot is treated through open-heart surgery. First, the pulmonary semilunar valve is widened or replaced and the pulmonary trunk is widened with a patch or stent. The ventricular septal defect (VSD) is repaired with a patch. These procedures solve the other two defects associated with this condition.
