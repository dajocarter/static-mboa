1. Splenic artery → trabecular artery → central arteriole → penicillar arteriole → **ensheathed capillary** → **splenic sinus** → red pulp vein → trabecular vein → splenic vein

Note that this option goes directly from the ensheathed capillary to the splenic sinus without going through the splenic cords, which is seen in *closed circulation*.
