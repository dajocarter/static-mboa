Lymph nodes have a capsule extending trabeculae into the parenchyma that is densely packed with lymphocytes. Lymph nodes also have morphologically distinct regions, however notice the lack of a paracortex, medullary cords, medullary sinuses, and lymphoid follicles in the patientâ€™s slide that are seen in lymph nodes.
