  slide: NER White Pulp
---

Correct! The spleen is located in the upper left abdominal quadrant (left hypochondriac region) in the peritoneal cavity. Notice the **white pulp** of lymphoid nodules with pale staining germinal centers surrounded by a darker staining marginal zone. The white pulp is surrounded by **red pulp**, the blood-filled stroma of fine reticulin fibers and cells. A thin capsule and the blood-filled stroma contribute to this organ being easily ruptured by abdominal injuries.

### Histology Scavenger Hunt!

Take a screenshot of [Slide 73, Spleen, Kornhauser’s Quad](https://medsci.indiana.edu/junqueira/virtual/73_bl_5.html), and find the following: **capsule**, **central arteriole**, **germinal center**, **marginal zone**, and **red pulp**


A few medical residents you are shadowing came from Harvard and they are extremely confused as to the function of the spleen (*watch "[What Does the Spleen Do? ft. Harvard Medical School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEi_4Cyx4Uw)" for homework if you haven’t seen it already!*).

Kindly explain to them 3 functions of this majestic organ.
