Although non-operative management is preferred in an attempt to save splenic function and avoid the risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI), the patient’s vitals indicate he is hemodynamically unstable and in an emergency situation. If instead the patient’s vital signs are less severe (hemodynamically stable), a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis may be done to evaluate potential trauma and decide on further medical treatment.
