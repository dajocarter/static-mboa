Perfect! Both **splanchnic mesoderm of the secondary heart field (SHF)** and **cranial neural crests cells** proliferate, migrate, and localize to the aorticopulmonary septum to complete its formation.

Disruption of this process can lead to asymmetrical division of the outflow tract. **Dextroposition of the aorta** (also known as **overriding aorta**) occurs when unequal outflow tract division causes an enlarged aorta that communicates with both ventricles over a **ventricular septal defect (VSD)**.

**List the steps of ventricular septation, starting from the muscular interventricular septum and ending with a complete interventricular septum.**

Since pressure is higher in the left ventricle than the right, the ventricular septal defect causes a left-to-right shunting of blood. The increased blood in the right ventricle coupled with pulmonary stenosis results in more work for the right ventricle, and subsequent enlargement of the myocardium.

What is the name of this condition?
