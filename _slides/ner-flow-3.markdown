*Elongated epithelial cells* line the walls of splenic sinusoids in the slide above ([Slide 73, Spleen, Kornhauserâ€™s Quad](https://medsci.indiana.edu/histo/virtual/73_bl_5.html)). These cells are oriented in the direction of blood flow, have few contact points, and a discontinuous basal lamina producing spaces between the cells. These spaces allow functional blood cells to reenter the vasculature while surrounding macrophages engulf old or damaged cells.
