Excellent work! Infants too weak or underdeveloped may not survive open-heart surgery and must therefore undergo a temporary, minimally-invasive procedure that will improve blood flow until they are candidates for the full operation.

You place a shunt  between the subclavian artery and pulmonary artery (known as a BT, or Blalock-Taussig, shunt) to provide an additional pathway for blood to travel to the lungs for oxygenation. You decide to monitor the infantâ€™s progress closely in order to determine the appropriate time for the full surgery and have the parents schedule a follow-up appointment.





*Congratulations! You completed a couple of curious cardiovascular cases. Go back to the beginning and play again!*
