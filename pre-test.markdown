problems:
- question_text: 'All of the following are true about the spleen except:'
  options:
  - option_text: "**a.** Reticulin fibers fill the stroma of the spleen"
    is_correct: false
  - is_correct: true
    option_text: "**b.** White pulp provides a location for B cells to proliferate
      and differentiate"
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**c.** In open circulation, penicillar arterioles dump blood directly
      into splenic cords"
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**d.** Stave cells present antigens to B lymphocytes in white pulp
      forming lymphoid nodules"
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**e.** T cells surround arterioles in the spleen, known as periarteriole
      lymphatic sheaths (PALS)"
- question_text: During an infection, why do lymph nodes increase in size?
  options:
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**a.** B cell proliferation forming lymphoid nodules (follicles)
      in the medulla"
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**b.** Enlargement of the subcapsular sinus with plasma cells"

      in the cortex"
- question_text: An embryologic malformation in the 3rd pharyngeal (branchial) pouch
    results in decreased differentiation of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) leading
    to thymic hypoplasia. What pathology would you expect from this smaller thymus?

      thymic stroma"
  - is_correct: true
    option_text: "**c.** Failure of thymic (Hassall's) corpuscles to form leading
      to decreased cytokine production for T cell development"
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**d.** An abundance of T-lymphocytes leading to overactive adaptive
      immune responses and autoimmunity"
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**e.** Both A and C are possibilities"
- question_text: Which of the following is true regarding M cells?
  options:
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**a.** They function to increase efficiency of lymphoid nodule activity
      in the appendix"
  - is_correct: true
    option_text: "**b.** They concentrate antigens, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes
      in intracellular pockets"
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**c.** They produce IgA mediating inflammatory reactions for defense
      of the mucosal surface"
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**d.** They produce hormones and other signaling molecules in response
      to antigen presentation in primary lymphoid organs"
  - is_correct: false
    option_text: "**e.** They are synonymous with enterocytes"
